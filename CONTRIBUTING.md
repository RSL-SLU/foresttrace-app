## Development setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install          # root (Express + tile-processing scripts)
cd client && npm install

# 2. Create client/.env with your client-side API key (never commit this file)
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=...

# 3. Create a root .env for the server-side AI assistant proxy (never commit this file)
GROQ_API_KEY=...        # powers the ForestryAI /api/chat proxy
MONGODB_URI=...         # optional — enables chat message logging

# 4. Start the dev server
cd client && npm start   # React app at http://localhost:3000
```

In development, `REACT_APP_TILES_BASE_URL` is empty so tiles are read from
`client/public/tiles/` via the CRA dev server. In production (Vercel), the
env var is set to the Cloudflare R2 public URL.

---

## Map renderers: Leaflet vs. MapLibre

The app can draw the map two ways, chosen at build time by env vars in
`client/.env` (unset = off):

```bash
REACT_APP_USE_MAPLIBRE=true          # switch from Leaflet to the MapLibre GL renderer
REACT_APP_USE_COG_CLEARCUT=true      # on the MapLibre path, draw clearcut from COGs instead of PNG tiles
```

- **Leaflet** (`MapContainer` in `App.js`, tiles via `RasterTileLayer.jsx`) is
  the renderer every visitor gets today. It reads pre-generated PNG XYZ tile
  pyramids and tints them per-pixel on a canvas.
- **MapLibre GL** (`MapLibreMap.jsx`, lazy-loaded so its ~400 kB bundle cost is
  only paid when the flag is on) is a WebGL renderer being brought to parity
  with the Leaflet path (stats tallying, biomass, etc. are still catching up).
  With `REACT_APP_USE_COG_CLEARCUT` also on, it reads **Cloud-Optimized
  GeoTIFFs (COGs)** directly — range-read over HTTP, so no tiling step or
  pyramid is needed for that layer. Without a COG for a given region/year, the
  MapLibre path falls back to the same PNG tiles Leaflet uses.

Both paths read the same underlying data; which one a given deployment runs is
purely an env var choice. See `client/src/config.js` for how a layer resolves
to a COG prefix (`cogPrefixForLayer`) versus a PNG tile URL, and the
[COG availability manifest](#cog-availability-manifest) section below for how
the app knows which region/year COGs actually exist.

---

## Adding a new analysis module

### 1. Create the component

Copy `client/src/modules/ModuleTemplate.jsx` and rename it:

```jsx
// client/src/modules/MyModule.jsx
function MyModule({ data }) {
  // data props available: percentage, selectedFMUs, selectedYear,
  // selectedSensor, onSensorChange, opacity, biomassHistogram
  return (
    <div className="clearcut-module">
      <div className="module-section">
        <h3>My Analysis</h3>
        <p>Region: {data.selectedFMUs?.[0]}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyModule;
```

### 2. Register it in App.js

```js
// client/src/App.js
import MyModule from './modules/MyModule';

const MODULES = [
  // ... existing modules ...
  {
    id: 'my-module',
    name: 'My Module',
    icon: '🌍',
    description: 'Short description shown in the sidebar',
    component: MyModule,
    temporalOptions: {
      yearRange: [2015, 2024],          // [min, max] for the year slider
      availableYears: [2015, 2020, 2024], // optional: discrete year list
    },
    layers: [
      {
        id: 'my-layer',
        name: 'My Layer',
        // Tile URL pattern — {region}, {year}, {z}, {x}, {y} are substituted at runtime
        tileUrl: `${TILES_BASE_URL}/tiles/my-layer/{region}_{year}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`,
        color: '#00BFFF',
        mode: 'annual',   // 'annual' | 'accumulated'
        tms: false,
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

Tiles are rendered by `RasterTileLayer`, which applies per-pixel canvas tinting
using the layer's `color`. If your layer needs custom rendering (e.g. a
different color formula), add a branch in
`client/src/components/RasterTileLayer.jsx` keyed on `layerId`.

This `tileUrl` pattern is what every layer falls back to. If you also want
your layer to draw from a COG on the MapLibre path (see
[Map renderers](#map-renderers-leaflet-vs-maplibre) above), add it to
`COG_PREFIX_BY_LAYER` in `client/src/config.js` instead of duplicating the URL
logic here.

### 3. Add statistics (optional)

If your module displays chart data derived from tiles, add a key to
`client/public/data/clearcut_stats.json`:

```json
{
  "wabigoon_my_layer": {
    "2015": 12345.6,
    "2020": 23456.7
  }
}
```

Then read it in your component via a utility in
`client/src/utils/clearcutAreaStats.js` (or add your own `utils/myStats.js`
following the same `loadStats()` singleton pattern).

---

## Tile pipeline

Tiles follow the standard XYZ/TMS pyramid structure:

```
tiles/<layer>/<region>_<year>/<z>/<x>/<y>.png
```

### Generating tiles locally

The processing scripts shown below are committed to the repo root. Other
one-off/local tooling scripts (data exploration, cleanup one-shots, etc.) stay
**gitignored** — no reason to version those. Committed scripts accept
`--local` (read/write `client/public/tiles/`) or `--production` (read/write
Cloudflare R2).

```bash
# Generate annual clearcut tiles from accumulated tiles (2-year lookback filter)
node generate-annual-clearcut-tiles.js --local wabigoon 2023

# Compute area statistics and write to clearcut_stats.json
node compute-clearcut-stats.js --local --annual wabigoon
```

Local tiles are placed under `client/public/tiles/` and served by the CRA dev
server at `http://localhost:3000/tiles/...`.

### Setting up R2 credentials

Copy `.env.r2.example` to `.env.r2` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.r2.example .env.r2
```

```ini
# .env.r2  — never commit this file
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=   # Cloudflare Dashboard → top-right "Account ID"
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=        # R2 → Manage R2 API Tokens → Create token
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=    # Shown once at token creation
R2_BUCKET_NAME=          # Exact bucket name, e.g. foresttrace-tiles
```

`.env.r2` is listed in `.gitignore` and must never be committed.

### Uploading tiles to Cloudflare R2

`upload-tiles.js` is committed to the repo. It reads from
`client/public/tiles/` and mirrors the directory tree to R2. You'll need R2
credentials to run it — ask a maintainer for the token values and fill them
into your own local `.env.r2` (see
[Setting up R2 credentials](#setting-up-r2-credentials) above; that file is
gitignored and must never be committed).

```bash
node upload-tiles.js --region wabigoon --layer clearcut-annual --year 2023
```

You can also use the `--production` flag on the processing scripts directly,
which reads from and writes to R2 without generating local copies:

```bash
node generate-annual-clearcut-tiles.js --production wabigoon 2023
node compute-clearcut-stats.js --production --annual wabigoon
```

### Tile URL routing

| Environment | `REACT_APP_TILES_BASE_URL` | Tile source |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Development | *(empty)* | `client/public/tiles/` (CRA dev server) |
| Production  | `https://pub-<id>.r2.dev` | Cloudflare R2 public bucket |

Set `REACT_APP_TILES_BASE_URL` in the Vercel project settings (not in a
committed `.env` file).

---

## Area statistics

`client/public/data/clearcut_stats.json` is a committed file that holds
precomputed hectare values. It is checked in so the app works without running
any scripts at startup.

After generating new tiles or updating a region, recompute and commit the JSON:

```bash
node compute-clearcut-stats.js --local --accumulated wabigoon
node compute-clearcut-stats.js --local --annual wabigoon
git add client/public/data/clearcut_stats.json
git commit -m "chore: update clearcut_stats for wabigoon 2024"
```

Accuracy metrics (precision / recall / F1 per year) are stored alongside the
area values under `<region>_<sensor>_accuracy` and are populated manually from
the training notebooks in `boreal-canada-mapping/notebooks/`.

---

## Clearcut patch vectors

`client/public/data/patches/<region>_<year>.json` holds the largest detected
clearcut patches for a region and year, as GeoJSON with a `rank` and `areaHa`
per feature. The Forestry AI Agent uses them to answer "highlight the biggest
clearcuts": the model chooses the query, and every coordinate comes from these
files rather than from the model.

Unlike `clearcut_stats.json`, these are **not committed** — they are bulk
generated geodata (~1.8 MB across the years) and are gitignored alongside
`client/public/data/regions/`. A fresh clone therefore has none, and
`highlight_patches` will refuse until you either point the app at R2 or
generate them locally.

### Generating them

The extraction lives in the `boreal-canada-mapping` repo, because it reads the
per-year classified rasters and shares the accumulation rule with them. It
needs that repo's Python environment (rasterio, shapely, pyproj):

```bash
cd ../boreal-canada-mapping
python scripts/extract_clearcut_patches.py \
    --results-dir /path/to/results \
    --out-dir     ../foresttrace-app/client/public/data/patches \
    --region wabigoon
```

`--results-dir` must contain `clearcut_definition/` (the per-year classified
rasters). Patches below `--min-ha` (default 5) are dropped as speckle, and
`--top` (default 50) caps how many are published per year — the file is fetched
by the browser, so that is a size budget as much as a data choice.

Regenerate whenever the accumulation rule changes: the patches are derived from
the same accumulated masks the map draws, so a rule change makes them stale.

### Publishing them

```bash
node upload-cogs.js client/public/data/patches data/patches
```

`upload-cogs.js` sets a short revalidating cache header on `.json` (unlike the
immutable one it uses for COGs, which live under versioned prefixes) precisely
because these are regenerated in place under the same filenames.

They are read through `REACT_APP_DATA_BASE_URL`, so the same routing as the
boundary files applies: empty in development (served from `client/public/`),
set to the R2 bucket in production.

---

## COG availability manifest

`cogs/manifest.json` on R2 lists which region/year COGs exist, per versioned
prefix. The app reads it before requesting any COG; without it, selecting all
39 FMUs issued ~195 HEAD probes at once and left the FMU boundaries queued
behind lookups for regions that have no COGs at all.

It is **generated, never committed** — it describes the bucket rather than the
source tree, so a checked-in copy goes stale the moment anyone uploads.
`client/public/cogs/` is gitignored, and development reads the published
manifest through the `/cogs` dev proxy.

`upload-cogs.js` re-indexes automatically whenever it uploads to a `cogs/`
prefix, so the manifest cannot drift from the bucket in normal use. Run it by
hand after any other change to the bucket:

```bash
node generate-cog-manifest.js --dry-run   # show what it would publish
node generate-cog-manifest.js             # rebuild from R2 and publish
```

A region whose COGs are on the bucket but absent from the manifest is treated as
having none, and falls back to the PNG pyramid silently — the map still draws,
so nothing looks broken. That is why the re-index is automatic rather than a
documented step.

If the manifest is missing entirely the app falls back to HEAD-probing each
region, which is correct but slow; that path exists so a bucket that has never
been indexed still works.

---

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Vercel. Pushes to `main` trigger automatic deploys.
Serverless API routes live under `api/` and are deployed as Vercel Functions.

Environment variables required in Vercel project settings:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `REACT_APP_TILES_BASE_URL` | R2 public CDN URL for tiles |
| `REACT_APP_DATA_BASE_URL` | R2 public CDN URL for data files |
| `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Google Places search (client-side) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | ForestryAI assistant — read server-side only, in `api/chat.js` |
| `MONGODB_URI` | Optional chat message logging (server-side only) |

`GROQ_API_KEY` and `MONGODB_URI` must **not** use the `REACT_APP_` prefix —
that prefix causes Create React App to bundle the value into the client
JavaScript, exposing it in the browser. None of these go in a committed
`.env` file.
